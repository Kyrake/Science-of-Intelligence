# ConceptsOfIntelligence

The advantages in the field of robotics during the last years are resulting in an uprise of autonomous and robotic systems in each area of the daily life. While the acceptance of robotic assistance in industrial settings is widely accepted, few insights are available when it comes to the acceptance of robot-human interaction in care taking scenarios or domestic environments. This presents the question who robot-human interaction is percieved by the average person and what attributes of partaking robots are influencial in those perceptions.
